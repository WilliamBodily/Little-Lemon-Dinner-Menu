Exercise: Little Lemon dinner menu

Overview

Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. The restaurant features a locally-sourced menu with daily specials.

Little Lemon has chosen to digitize its menu, which makes it relatively easy for customers to browse menu items at night. Also, the customers can perform search queries with filter and sort options to find the items they are interested in faster.
